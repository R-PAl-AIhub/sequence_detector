## Features

- **Beautiful UI** - Premium dark theme with glassmorphism effects
- **Dual Machine Types** - Support for both Mealy and Moore state machines
- **Overlap Detection** - Toggle between overlapping and non-overlapping modes
- **Interactive Visualization** - Step-by-step state transitions with animations
- **Real-time Testing** - Test any binary sequence against your detector
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

## Live Demo

## How to Use

1. **Choose Machine Type**: Select Mealy or Moore
2. **Set Overlap Mode**: Choose overlapping or non-overlapping detection
3. **Enter Pattern**: Input the binary pattern you want to detect (e.g., `101`)
4. **Generate**: Click "Generate State Machine" to visualize the state diagram
5. **Test**: Enter a test sequence and click "Run Test"
6. **Navigate**: Use Next/Previous buttons or click on steps to see transitions

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Structure
- **CSS3** - Styling with modern features (Grid, Flexbox, Animations)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Logic and interactivity
- **SVG** - State diagram rendering
- **Google Fonts** - Typography (Outfit)

## Installation

No installation required! Just open `index.html` in a modern web browser.

For local development:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sequence-detector-visualizer.git

# Navigate to directory
cd sequence-detector-visualizer

# Open in browser
start index.html  # Windows
open index.html   # macOS
xdg-open index.html  # Linux
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Detect "101"
- **Pattern**: `101`
- **Test Input**: `110101`
- **Result**: Found at positions 4, 6 (overlapping mode)

### Example 2: Detect "1001"
- **Pattern**: `1001`
- **Test Input**: `1001001`
- **Result**: Found at positions 1, 4 (overlapping mode)

## Features in Detail

### State Machine Generation
- Automatically generates states based on pattern length
- Calculates transitions for both 0 and 1 inputs
- Handles both Mealy and Moore machine types

### Visualization
- Clean "Highway" layout for easy understanding
- Color-coded states (start, active, visited)
- Animated transitions with flowing effects
- Pulsing active state indicator

### Testing
- Step-by-step execution
- Visual highlighting of current state and transition
- Detection markers for pattern matches
- Navigation controls (Next, Previous, Reset)
